            <h1>Hey there.</h1>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my website.</p>
            <p>I designed it for a class called MMC3260: Your Digital Life, and, as you can see, it's still a work in progress. This is the first time I've coded a website using HTML5 and CSS, though I've messed around with HTML in the past (years ago). Hopefully, the site displays properly on both your computer and your phone.</p>
            <p>If you click through, you'll find information about me, ways to reach me and some outside sources I recommend checking out.</p>
